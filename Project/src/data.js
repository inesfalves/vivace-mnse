      description:
        "It began in the age of rock ‘n roll. In the ’50s, the music of the previous decades—including swing music and crooning vocals—was being replaced.\n" +
        "Rock was growing, and at the same time as it did, the beginning of true pop music was growing too, out of the creations of producer Mitch Miller.\n" +
        "Miller worked at the most successful label of the time, Columbia Records, and he working with the label’s big artists to create a sound that was not confined to one simple genre.\n" +
        "He was combining country, blues, and folk music with the mainstream rock sounds that everyone was listening to, and the result was something that took the focus away from the large, sweeping orchestras of the previous decades, and placed it on the emotion of the music, evident in the sounds of artists like Johnnie Ray, Frankie Laine, and Guy Mitchell — all of whom worked with Mitch Miller. \n" +
        "This decade was also one of celebration for Elvis Presley, who came around in 1953, and whose songs, like “Hound Dog” were some of the most loved of the time.\n",

        "Through its beginning, pop had been characterized by its largely teen fan base, and in the ‘60s, when the portable radio was introduced, it became even easier for teens to take their tunes wherever they went.\n" +
        "Pop was traveling, and picking up influences — from the beaches of California, bands like the Beach Boys were taking the harmonies from traditional pop songs and layering them with the “surf rock” rhythm that they became known for.\n" +
        "But the true driving force of pop in the ‘60s came from across the Atlantic, with Beatlemania and the British Invasion into the American charts. The British Invasion brought rock and pop music and bands to the U.S., where they became wildly popular.\n" +
        "The Beatles were among these acts, and their mix of beat, rock, and pop ballads immediately took over American pop charts.\n" +
        "Through all of this, the pop genre was forming into something not solely defined by the American solo-pop artists of the previous decade. \n" +
        "Now, bands were introduced into the fray, and pop was splitting into sub-genres that included Bubblegum pop—defined by its upbeat sound and its direct aim at teen audiences—and Baroque pop, which blended pop and rock and baroque music together..\n",

        "Elton John, with his repertoire of diverse sounds ranging from pop ballads to arena rock songs, became one of the biggest pop stars of the time. “Bennie and the Jets” and “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” are regarded today as musical classics.\n" +
        "Meanwhile, Queen was venturing from their hard rock song into the arena rock and pop rock that was so popular on the radio at the time, and the Jackson 5 was becoming a pop phenomenon with their own hit singles, like “I Want You Back” and “ABC”.\n",

        "Teen pop was existing in the music of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera; pop rock and power pop were making a comeback in the sounds of Blink 182’s “All the Small Things”, opening up a gate for the musicians that would come to be pivotal within the pop-punk genre, like Simple Plan and Fall Out Boy.\n" +
        "Towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s, pop was again being influenced with hip hop and R&B sounds through Rihanna’s music, and electronic sounds made themselves known in Lady Gaga’s sounds from her album, Poker Face, which went on to win two Grammys.\n" +
        "Pop music had become an electric melting pot of subgenres and sounds that all shared the common tropes of a pop song.\n",

      description:
        "Pop music had remained significantly popular due to dance-pop, electropop and synth-pop in this decade.\n" +
        "Most decades in popular music have been defined by genres, formats or geographies, but the 2010s can be perhaps best defined by platforms.\n" +
        "Spotify launched in the US, as well as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and a Jay-Z-rebranded Tidal, and streaming figures became included in the singles and album charts. Social media broke down walls by creating direct lines of communication between artists and fans, with followers, memes and challenges on YouTube, Instagram and more recently TikTok becoming a crucial window for both fans and A&R departments.\n" +
        "As a result, it was a time in which music became truly global, and genres seemed to mutate and fuse. Latin and K-pop became established as major genres, EDM entered the mainstream. Hip-hop was elevated to a new level, outselling rock music for the first time, and saw subgenres like trap and SoundCloud rap achieving mainstream success.\n" +
        "The 2010s was also bookended by two young female artists – Adele and Billie Eilish – who in their own way personified the present and future of popular music.\n",
