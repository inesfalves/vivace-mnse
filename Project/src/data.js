                "Digital recording became huge in the ‘80s, and the possibilities it offered allowed pop music to grow even more.\n" +
                "Suddenly, synthesizers and electronic sounds could be put into pop music, and as this kind of dance-pop developed, so did genres like techno.\n" +
                "And the artists who emerged in these years were revolutionary for pop—Michael Jackson’s Thriller is still the best-selling album of all time.\n" +
                "Jackson was becoming the biggest pop star of the decade, followed closely by Prince, who had his own pop stardom to claim.\n" +
                "His music, which pulled from pop, rock, funk, and so much more, coupled with his extravagant and flamboyant presence catapulted him into a spotlight never truly faded away.\n" +
                "Female pop powerhouses were also coming into play, like Whitney Houston and Madonna. The latter became the most successful female artist of the decade, with songs like “Like A Virgin”.\n" +
                "The ‘80s was creating a pop-music culture like no other decade had before it, a culture that would carry through in the decades to come.\n",
