      "Digital recording became huge in the ‘80s, and the possibilities it offered allowed pop music to grow even more.\n" +
      "Suddenly, synthesizers and electronic sounds could be put into pop music, and as this kind of dance-pop developed, so did genres like techno.\n" +
      "And the artists who emerged in these years were revolutionary for pop—Michael Jackson’s Thriller is still the best-selling album of all time.\n" +
      "Jackson was becoming the biggest pop star of the decade, followed closely by Prince, who had his own pop stardom to claim.\n" +
      "His music, which pulled from pop, rock, funk, and so much more, coupled with his extravagant and flamboyant presence catapulted him into a spotlight never truly faded away.\n" +
      "Female pop powerhouses were also coming into play, like Whitney Houston and Madonna. The latter became the most successful female artist of the decade, with songs like “Like A Virgin”.\n" +
      "The ‘80s was creating a pop-music culture like no other decade had before it, a culture that would carry through in the decades to come.\n",

    description:
      "While the ‘90s saw pop continuing much as it had been in the past, what it introduced to the genre was girl groups.\n" +
      "The decade saw the British Girl group, The Spice Girls, emerge into the American market and become the most commercially successful British Group in North America since the Beatles.\n" +
      "They were also the most successful female-pop group, and one of the most successful pop-groups ever, with their single “Spice Up Your Life”.\n" +
      "The next ten years would see teen pop groups and singers pop up all over the charts, including the Backstreet Boys with “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)”,\n" +
      "and Britney Spears with “Baby One More Time” — one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n",

    description:
      "By the 2000s, pop was a genre with endless roads for artists to travel down, each with its own flair and twist to the classic traditions of pop music.\n" +
      "Teen pop was existing in the music of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera; pop rock and power pop were making a comeback in the sounds of Blink 182’s “All the Small Things”, opening up a gate for the musicians that would come to be pivotal within the pop-punk genre, like Simple Plan and Fall Out Boy.\n" +
      "Towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s, pop was again being influenced with hip hop and R&B sounds through Rihanna’s music, and electronic sounds made themselves known in Lady Gaga’s sounds from her album, Poker Face, which went on to win two Grammys.\n" +
      "Pop music had become an electric melting pot of subgenres and sounds that all shared the common tropes of a pop song.\n",
